# Airbnb_Blacklist_Chrome_Extension
A chrome extension that lets you blacklist Airbnb results that you do not want to see again.

# About
I made this for fun in a couple hours for a random reddit user that requested it. 

# How To Use: 
* [Download the files](https://github.com/lukeprofits/Airbnb_Blacklist_Chrome_Extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 
* Extract the contents of the zipped folder. 
* Go to `chrome://extensions/` and toggle on developer mode on the top right 
* Click "load unpacked extension" on the top left
* Browse to the "Airbnb_Blacklist" folder and select it.
* When you go to an airbnb search page, after 5 seconds, ignore buttons will show up. Once clicked, these will hide this result from view. 
* If you want to stop hiding search results, go back to `chrome://extensions/` and remove the extension.
